#### Crafting the Transformer: An Object-Oriented Approach

In this section, we're going to construct a Transformer model from the ground up. Our methodology is inspired by the insights of Umar Jamil—be sure to check out his work for a deeper understanding.

To bring the Transformer to life, we've broken down the development process into two primary segments: modeling and training. We'll start with modeling, which is crucial to grasp before we proceed to the training phase. As a constant guide, we've placed an image of the Transformer architecture in the right corner of the page for your reference.

Within our `model.py`, we've crafted a robust framework composed of nine classes and one essential function. These components form the backbone of our implementation:

Understanding the Architecture
In the forthcoming sections, we'll dissect how each of these twelve classes contributes to a functioning Transformer model. It's important to recognize the role of each component:

**Classes:** They represent distinct, well-defined parts of our model, encapsulating specific functionalities.
Object-Oriented Design: This paradigm ensures our code is modular, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
By the end of this exploration, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of the nuts and bolts of the Transformer model. Stay tuned as we delve into the intricacies of each class and function, paving the way towards a robust implementation.

`Remember, the full codebase on GitHub will offer a more granular look at the inner workings of the model. This guide aims to provide a high-level understanding, ensuring you grasp the architectural decisions and algorithmic flow that define the Transformer.`

## Input Embeddings

```python
class InputEmbeddings(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model:int , vocab_size:int ):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.embedding(x) * math.sqrt(self.d_model)
```
     `d_model: int` - The dimensionality of the embedding space.
     `vocab_size: int` - The size of the vocabulary of source language.
     `Forward Method`- Accepts input `x` and produces embeddings scaled by the square root of `d_model`, leading to an output size of `(vocab_size, d_model)`.

   **Notes**
    > The embedding layer weights are scaled by the square root of `d_model` as suggested in the original paper.

## Positional Encoding

The `PositionalEncoding` is designed to provide each token in a sequence with a unique position encoding.
Consider this example:

<Image src={pe} alt="Positional encoding diagram." />

In the sentence `'I love watching birds'`, the word `'I'` is at position 0, and the word 'birds' is at position 3. Each word is converted into a vector representation with a dimension of d_model(This is from embeddings layer). Positional encoding adds positional information to each vector. This is achieved by using a 'pos' attribute, where the even positions in the vector receive a sine function value, and the odd positions receive a cosine function value, as illustrated below

```python
class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, d_model: int, seq_len: int , dropout: float) ->None:
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.seq_len = seq_len
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        pe = torch.zeros(seq_len,d_model)
        position = torch.arange(0,seq_len, dtype = torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0,d_model,2).float()*(-math.log(10000.0)/d_model))
        pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        pe = pe.unsqueeze(0)
        self.register_buffer('pe',pe)

    def forward(self,x):
        x = x+(self.pe[:,:x.shape[1],:]).requires_grad_(False)
        return self.dropout(x)
```

- **Constructor (`__init__` method)**
  - Initializes the positional encoding with the following parameters:
    - `d_model` (int): Represents the dimensionality of the embedding space.
    - `seq_len` (int): The maximum length of the sequence to be encoded.
    - `dropout` (float): The dropout rate for regularization.

Within the constructor:

- A zero matrix `pe` of shape `(seq_len, d_model)` is created to store the positional encodings.
- The `position` tensor is generated with values from `0` to `seq_len-1` and reshaped by `unsqueeze(1)` to have a shape of `(seq_len, 1)`. This function is used to add a dimension, making matrix operations possible.
- `div_term` calculates a divisor used in the alternating sine and cosine functions based on the model's dimension and a fixed constant (10000.0). The `exp` and `arange` functions create values for this divisor.
- Sine is applied to even indices in the positional encoding matrix, while cosine is applied to odd indices. This alternation provides a unique pattern for each position.
- The `unsqueeze(0)` is used on `pe` to add a batch dimension, making it compatible with the expected input dimensions.

- **Register Buffer**
  - The `register_buffer` method is used to create a persistent, non-learnable buffer for the positional encoding tensor `pe`. This buffer is not a parameter of the model and will not be updated during training, but it will be part of the model's state, allowing for easy saving and loading.

- **Forward Method (`forward` method)**
  - In the forward pass, the input `x` is added to the positional encodings, ensuring that each token's position is considered.
  - The positional encodings up to `x.shape[1]` (the sequence length of the batch) are used, and `requires_grad_` is set to `False` to indicate that no gradient should be computed.
  - Finally, dropout is applied to the resulting tensor.

**Important Points:**
- The output tensor maintains the shape `(batch, seq_len, d_model)`, adhering to the expected input dimensions for subsequent layers.
- Keeping track of tensor shapes at each operation is a crucial practice for debugging.
- The module's design, which includes sinusoidal patterns and a non-learnable buffer, is a deliberate choice to provide the model with an effective way to interpret token positions without increasing the number of trainable parameters.

## Layer Normalization

```python
class LayerNormalization(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, eps:float = 10**-6)->None:
        super().__init__()
        self.eps = eps
        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))

    def forward(self, x):
        mean = x.mean(dim = -1, keepdim=True)
        std = x.std(dim = -1, keepdim=True)
        return self.alpha * (x-mean)/(std +self.eps)+self.bias
```

The `LayerNormalization` module stabilizes the activation distribution throughout the training process.

- `self.alpha` is a learnable scaling parameter, initialized to one.
- `self.bias` is a learnable shifting parameter, initialized to zero.
- The forward pass computes the mean and standard deviation across the last dimension of the input `x`, normalizes it, then applies the learned scale and shift.
- The epsilon value `eps` adds stability to the normalization process.

## Feed Forward Block

```python
class FeedForwardBlock(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, d_model: int, d_ff:int, dropout:float) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.linear_1 = nn.Linear(d_model, d_ff)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.linear_2 = nn.Linear(d_ff, d_model)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear_2(self.dropout(torch.relu(self.linear_1(x))))
```

The `FeedForwardBlock` is used in both encoder and decoder. It consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
    <Image src={ff_image} alt="Feedforward Block diagram." />
</div>

- `d_model`: Input and output feature dimension.
- `d_ff`: Hidden layer dimension, typically larger than `d_model`.
- Dropout is applied after the activation function to reduce overfitting.

## Multi-Head Attention Block

```python
class MultiHeadAttentionBlock(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self,d_model: int,h:int, dropout:float) ->None:
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model =d_model
        self.h = h
        assert d_model % h == 0, "d_model is not divisible by h"
        self.d_k = d_model//h
        self.w_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.w_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.w_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.w_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    @staticmethod
    def attention(query, key, value, mask, dropout: nn.Dropout):
        d_k = query.shape[-1]
        # (batch, h, seq_len, d_k) --> (batch, h, seq_len, seq_len)
        attention_scores = (query @ key.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
        if mask is not None:
            attention_scores.masked_fill_(mask == 0, -1e9)
        attention_scores = attention_scores.softmax(dim=-1)
        if dropout is not None:
            attention_scores = dropout(attention_scores)
        return (attention_scores @ value), attention_scores

    def forward(self, q, k, v, mask):
        query = self.w_q(q)
        key = self.w_k(k)
        value = self.w_v(v)
        query = query.view(query.shape[0], query.shape[1], self.h, self.d_k).transpose(1,2)
        key   = key.view(key.shape[0], key.shape[1], self.h, self.d_k).transpose(1,2)
        value = value.view(value.shape[0], value.shape[1], self.h, self.d_k).transpose(1,2)
        x, self.attention_scores = MultiHeadAttentionBlock.attention(query, key, value, mask, self.dropout)
        x = x.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(x.shape[0],-1,self.h * self.d_k)
        return self.w_o(x)
```

The `MultiHeadAttentionBlock` is the crux of the attention mechanism:

- The `attention` function is a `staticmethod`, allowing it to be used across encoder and decoder without a class instance.
- Queries, keys, and values are reshaped into 4D tensors to facilitate multi-head processing.
- The model concurrently processes inputs through multiple attention 'heads', focusing on different aspects of the input sequence.
- Multi-head attention is used three times in the transformer — twice in the decoder and once in the encoder.

## Residual Connection

```python
class ResidualConnection(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, dropout: float)->None:
        super().__init__()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.norm = LayerNormalization()

    def forward(self, x, sublayer):
        return x +self.dropout(sublayer(self.norm(x)))
```

The residual connection (`x + ...`) allows gradients to flow directly through the network without being hindered by deep layers. Layer normalization is applied before the sublayer, and dropout regularizes the output.

## Encoder Block

```python
class EncoderBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, self_attention_block: MultiHeadAttentionBlock, feed_forward_block: FeedForwardBlock, dropout:float):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attention_block = self_attention_block
        self.feed_forward_block = feed_forward_block
        self.residual_connection = nn.ModuleList([ResidualConnection(dropout) for _ in range(2)])

    def forward(self, x, src_mask):
        x = self.residual_connection[0](x, lambda x:self.self_attention_block(x,x,x, src_mask))
        x = self.residual_connection[1](x, self.feed_forward_block)
        return x
```

Each encoder block applies self-attention followed by a feed-forward network, with residual connections around both.

## Encoder

```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, layers: nn.ModuleList) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = layers
        self.norm = LayerNormalization()

    def forward(self,x, mask):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x,mask)
        return self.norm(x)
```

The encoder iteratively processes input through each encoder block, with a final layer normalization.

## Decoder Block

```python
class DecoderBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, self_attention_block:MultiHeadAttentionBlock, cross_attention_Block: MultiHeadAttentionBlock,
                    feed_forward_block:FeedForwardBlock, dropout: float):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attention_block = self_attention_block
        self.cross_attention_Block = cross_attention_Block
        self.feed_forward_block = feed_forward_block
        self.residual_connections = nn.ModuleList([ResidualConnection(dropout) for _ in range(3)])

    def forward(self, x, encoder_output, src_mask, tgt_mask):
        x = self.residual_connections[0](x, lambda x: self.self_attention_block(x,x,x,tgt_mask))
        x = self.residual_connections[1](x, lambda x: self.self_attention_block(x,encoder_output,encoder_output,src_mask))
        x = self.residual_connections[2](x, self.feed_forward_block)
        return x
```

The decoder block integrates three operations: self-attention (masked), cross-attention with encoder output, and feed-forward processing. Three residual connections wrap each component.

## Decoder

```python
class Decoder(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, layers: nn.ModuleList) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = layers
        self.norm = LayerNormalization()

    def forward(self, x, encoder_output, src_mask, tgt_mask):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x, encoder_output, src_mask, tgt_mask)
        return self.norm(x)
```

The target mask (`tgt_mask`) prevents the decoder from seeing future tokens — essential for autoregressive generation.

## Projection Layer

```python
class ProjectionLayer(nn.ModuleList):

    def __init__(self, d_model:int, vocal_size:int ) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.proj = nn.Linear(d_model, vocal_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.log_softmax(self.proj(x),dim=-1)
```

Maps the decoder output from `d_model` dimensions to vocabulary size, applying log softmax for numerical stability.

## Transformer

```python
class Transformer(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, encoder:Encoder, decoder: Decoder, src_embed: InputEmbeddings,
                 tgt_embed: InputEmbeddings, src_pos: PositionalEncoding, tgt_pos: PositionalEncoding,
                 Projection_Layer: ProjectionLayer)-> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.decoder = decoder
        self.src_emded = src_embed
        self.tgt_embed = tgt_embed
        self.src_pos = src_pos
        self.tgt_pos = tgt_pos
        self.projection_layer = Projection_Layer

    def encode(self, src, src_mask):
        src = self.src_emded(src)
        src = self.src_pos(src)
        return self.encoder(src, src_mask)

    def decode(self, encoder_output, src_mask, tgt, tgt_mask):
        tgt = self.tgt_embed(tgt)
        tgt = self.tgt_pos(tgt)
        return self.decoder(tgt, encoder_output, src_mask, tgt_mask)

    def project(self, x):
        return self.projection_layer(x)
```

The Transformer class ties everything together: encode the source, decode the target using encoder output, then project to vocabulary space.

## Build Transformer

```python
def build_transformer(src_vocab_size: int, tgt_vocab_size: int,
                      src_seq_len: int, tgt_seq_len: int, d_model:int = 512,
                      N: int = 6 , h: int = 8, dropout: float = 0.1, d_ff: int = 2048 )->Transformer:
    src_embed = InputEmbeddings(d_model, src_vocab_size)
    tgt_embed = InputEmbeddings(d_model, tgt_vocab_size)

    src_pos = PositionalEncoding(d_model, src_seq_len, dropout)
    tgt_pos = PositionalEncoding(d_model, tgt_seq_len, dropout)

    encoder_blocks = []
    for _ in range(6):
        encoder_self_attention_block = MultiHeadAttentionBlock(d_model, h, dropout)
        feed_forward_block = FeedForwardBlock(d_model, d_ff, dropout)
        encoder_block = EncoderBlock(encoder_self_attention_block, feed_forward_block, dropout)
        encoder_blocks.append(encoder_block)

    decorder_blocks = []
    for _ in range(N):
        decoder_self_attention_block = MultiHeadAttentionBlock(d_model, h, dropout)
        decorder_cross_attention_block = MultiHeadAttentionBlock(d_model, h, dropout)
        feed_forward_block = FeedForwardBlock(d_model, d_ff, dropout)
        decoder_block = DecoderBlock(decoder_self_attention_block, decorder_cross_attention_block, feed_forward_block, dropout)
        decorder_blocks.append(decoder_block)

    encoder = Encoder(nn.ModuleList(encoder_blocks))
    decorder = Decoder(nn.ModuleList(decorder_blocks))

    projection_layer = ProjectionLayer(d_model, tgt_vocab_size)

    transformer = Transformer(encoder, decorder, src_embed, tgt_embed, src_pos, tgt_pos, projection_layer)

    for p in transformer.parameters():
        if p.dim() >1:
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(p)

    return transformer
```

The factory function assembles all components and initializes parameters with Xavier uniform initialization — a common practice for preventing vanishing/exploding gradients in deep networks like the Transformer.
