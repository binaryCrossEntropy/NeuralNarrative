## Single Headed Attention

<Image src={single_head} alt="Single-headed attention mechanism diagram." />

- Ignore the Softmax operation and normalize by dividing by the square root of `d_model`, because these operations do not affect the dimensions of the matrices involved.

## Multi-Headed Attention

<Image src={multi_head} alt="Multi-headed attention mechanism diagram." />

- Ignore the Softmax operation and normalize by dividing by the square root of `d_model`, because these operations do not affect the dimensions of the matrices involved.
